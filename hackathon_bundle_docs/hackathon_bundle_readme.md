Redrob Hackathon — Participant Bundle

Welcome to the Intelligent Candidate Discovery & Ranking Challenge.

# **What's in this bundle**

| **File** | **What it is** |
| --- | --- |
| candidates.jsonl.gz | The 100,000-candidate pool you'll rank. Gzipped JSONL (~52 MB compressed, ~465 MB uncompressed). |
| sample_candidates.json | First 50 candidates as pretty-printed JSON. Use this to inspect the schema quickly. |
| job_description.md | The job description you're ranking candidates against. **Read it carefully — including the section at the end specifically for hackathon participants.** |
| submission_spec.md | **Read this in full before starting.** Submission format, rules, compute constraints, evaluation stages. |
| submission_metadata_template.yaml | Template for the metadata you'll provide alongside your submission. |
| candidate_schema.json | JSON Schema describing every field in a candidate record. |
| redrob_signals_doc.md | Reference for the 23 behavioral signals in each candidate's redrob_signals object. |
| sample_submission.csv | A format reference. **Not a high-quality ranking** — just an example of the CSV structure your submission should match. |
| validate_submission.py | Format validator. Run this on your submission before uploading. |

 

# **Getting started**

## **1. Read the docs (~30 minutes)**

In this order:

1.       job_description.md — understand what role you're ranking candidates for

2.       submission_spec.md — understand the rules and evaluation pipeline

3.       redrob_signals_doc.md — understand the trap candidates and signal envelopes

4.       candidate_schema.json — understand the candidate data structure

5.       Open sample_candidates.json and skim a few candidates to see what real data looks like

## **2. Unpack the candidate pool**

gunzip -k candidates.jsonl.gz   # -k keeps the .gz; you get both files
 wc -l candidates.jsonl      	# should print 100000

Or load the gzipped file directly in Python:

import gzip, json
 with gzip.open("candidates.jsonl.gz", "rt") as f:
 	candidates = [json.loads(line) for line in f if line.strip()]
 print(len(candidates))  # 100000

## **3. Build your ranker**

Your job: produce a CSV with the **top 100 candidates** for the JD, ranked best-fit first, with a 1-2 sentence reasoning for each.

The format is described in submission_spec.md Section 2-3. The compute constraints are in Section 3 (5 min, 16 GB, CPU only, no network during ranking).

## **4. Validate before submitting**

This catches format errors before you upload. The validator handles both .jsonl and gzipped .jsonl.gz files.

## **5. Submit**

Submit via the portal. You'll be asked for:

·         The CSV file

·         All the metadata from submission_metadata_template.yaml (team name, GitHub repo, **sandbox link**, AI tools declaration, etc.)

·         See submission_spec.md Section 10 for the full list

Sandbox link is **required** — a working hosted environment (HuggingFace Spaces, Streamlit Cloud, Replit, Colab, Docker, or Binder) where your ranker can be run on a small sample. See Section 10.5 for what counts as a valid sandbox.

# **Key things to know**

·         **No live leaderboard.** Scores are revealed only after submissions close. There is no feedback during the competition.

·         **Three submissions max.** Your last valid submission counts.

·         **AI tools are allowed.** Declare them honestly. The evaluation is designed so that AI-assisted work where you did real engineering succeeds, while AI-only submissions fail at Stages 3-5.

·         **The dataset contains traps.** Keyword stuffers, plain-language Tier 5s, behavioral twins, and ~80 honeypots with subtly impossible profiles.Submissions with honeypot rate > 10% in top 100 are disqualified you. See redrob_signals_doc.md.

·         **You will be interviewed if you reach the top X.** Be prepared to walk through your architecture and defend your design choices.

# **Asking for help**

If you find a bug in the bundle (e.g., schema doesn't match data, validator rejects valid format) please report it via the official hackathon support channel.

Good luck.
