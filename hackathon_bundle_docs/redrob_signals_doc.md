Redrob Behavioral Signals — Reference

This document explains the 23 behavioral signals embedded in each candidate's redrob_signals object, how they relate to candidate quality, and how they're constructed in the synthetic dataset.

# What are Redrob signals?

In a real recruiting platform, candidates generate observable behavior beyond what they list in their profile:

Do they actually respond to recruiter messages?

Have they logged in recently?

Did they complete the assessments they started?

Are recruiters saving their profile?

Have they completed previous interview cycles?

These behavioral signals are often **more predictive** of whether a candidate can actually be hired than their static profile. A perfect-on-paper candidate who hasn't logged in for 6 months and has a 5% response rate is, for hiring purposes, not actually available.

This dataset includes these signals so that ranking systems can incorporate them as a multiplier or modifier on top of skill-match scoring.
